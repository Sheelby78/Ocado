I wrote a program that implements an order picking scheduling algorithm. When you will run it, you will see a simple menu where you can choose which type of optimization you want to use. My main algorithm is divided into two cases, first is when every order has to be picked, and it is possible to do it. Second is when it is impossible to pick every order, and we have to choose which order finish and which not. I also made a tests to this algorithms that you can see in test directory.
